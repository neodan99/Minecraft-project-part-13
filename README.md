# Minecraft-project-part-13
The code should all be up to date to the end of part 13.
Game appears to be in turbo mode! Running, jumping is like 80mph!

Placing, breaking blocks causes a 3-5 blocks remove or add. Average is 5 blocks. Totally random, can't find a rhyme or reason, sometimes they stack on top of eachother, creating a S or corkscrew pattern, then sometimes it's a straight line with, it's always different. The least number of blocks I see added or removed is 2. Never just one though.

It seems to me the game is detecting input as if I'm holding the 'Q' button even if I just barely tap it.

Not sure if the game speed and block placing issue are related, but seems like it?
