# Minecraft-project-part-13
The code should all be up to date to the end of part 13.
Game appears to be in turbo mode! Running, jumping is like 80mph!

Placing, breaking blocks causes a 3-5 blocks remove or add. Average is 5 blocks. Totally random, can't find a rhyme or reason, sometimes they stack on top of eachother, creating a S or corkscrew pattern, then sometimes it's a straight line, sometimes it makes an 'L' shape, it's always different. The least number of blocks I see added or removed is 2. Never just one though. And usually it's 5 blocks each time. I don't think it ever places more than 5.

It seems to me the game is detecting input as if I'm holding the 'Q' button even if I just barely tap it. Similar effect if I right click once to remove a block. 3-5 get removed whether it's blocks I placed or blocks generated.

Not sure if the game speed and block placing issue are related, but seems like it?

Tried on two computers: 2020 macbook pro, m1 processor, 16 GB ram & also Surface pro 6 ~2019 / i5-825OU processor, 1.8 GHz, 8gb ram.
